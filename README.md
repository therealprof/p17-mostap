Build information around the Boldport Club project 17 - MOSTAP -- or this is how I did it, step by step... ðŸ˜ƒ

## Unpacking

## The pieces

Here I clipped the the paper strips off to avoid messing up the legs and ordered them:

Next I prepared the 1M and 10M resistors by bending the legs directly at the body:

## The works

As usual the mounting order with through hole components is from lowest to highest profile. I made two slight exceptions for the straight connections (for which I needed the clippings which I didn't have yet) and the diodes which require special care while bending to get the right length...

First I started by placing the 1M and 10M resistors into the right holes:

Then I bent the pins on the solder side of the board to keep them in place:
